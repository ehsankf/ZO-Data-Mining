

This package contains the C++ source codes for the Variance Reduced Stochastic Gradient descent (VR-SGD) method developed in the paper:

"VR-SGD: A Simple Stochastic Variance Reduction Method for Machine Learning" 

Submitted to IEEE TPAMI (under review). 


It is provided as-is, use it at your own risk :)

The implemented algorithms include AGD, SGD, SVRG, SVRG++, Katyusha and VR-SGD, which can be used to solve various machine learning problems 
such as Logistic Regression and Ridge Regression. Please refer to the paper about the details of these algorithms.   
 

You can compile the source code by Matlab to get your own compiled files as well, instead of using our precompiled code (which is for windows 64bit only).

If you have any questions about the code, feel free to contact Fanhua Shang: fhshang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk
