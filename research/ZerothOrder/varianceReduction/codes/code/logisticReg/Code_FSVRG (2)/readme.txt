
This package contains the C++ source codes for the fast stochastic variance reduction gradient (FSVRG) method developed in the paper:

"Snapshot Momentum: Accelerating Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Descent for Empirical Risk Minimization". 

Submitted to CVPR 2018. 


It is provided as-is, use it at your own risk :)

The implemented algorithms include SVRG, SVRG++, Katyusha and FSVRG, which can be used to solve various empirical risk minimization problems such as Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression and SVM. Please refer to the paper about the details of these algorithms.   
 

You can compile the source code by Matlab to get your own compiled files as well, instead of using our precompiled code (which is for windows 64bit only).
